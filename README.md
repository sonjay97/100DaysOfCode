## A repo of all the projects created during the #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Index

### Day One: 
- Age to Days Calculator in C++
- A simple project that converts your age (in years) to days!

### Day Two: 
- Pattern Maker Using The Alphabet in C++
- A simple project using nested for loops to print a right triangle made of letters!
- This project in C++ is a little bit more advanced than the day one project and uses nested for loops to create a right triangle pattern. Check out my instagram for more details on how this code works.
