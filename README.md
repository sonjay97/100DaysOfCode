# 100DaysOfCode
## A repo of all the projects created during the #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Index

### Day One: 
- Age to Days Calculator in C++
- A simple project that converts your age (in years) to days!

### Day Two: 
- Pattern Maker Using The Alphabet in C++
- A simple project using nested for loops to print a right triangle made of letters!
- This project in C++ is a little bit more advanced than the day one project and uses nested for loops to create a right triangle pattern. Check out my instagram for more details on how this code works. 

### Day Three: 
- A program that computes how much a customer has to pay after purchasing two items!
- A simple project that uses if/else statements and basic math to calculate what a customer owes.
- This project in C++ is a little bit more advanced than the day one project and uses math that is a little more complex. Still, it is a great way to get your feet wet with coding in C++!

### Day Four: 
- A program challenge from leet code! The infamous "two sum". This was pretty tough for me, and if it is for you to don't worry you're not alone :).

### Day Six: 
- A program that computes an integer out of a roman number input!
- so interesting.

### Day Eight: 
- A program that prints triangles made out of "*" but using recursion instead of nested for loops!
- much wow

### Day Nine: 
- How much do you know about Object Oriented Programming? 
- This is a basic exercise in OOP that demonstrates how different classes can be given different attributes and functions to virtually make a program do     anything you need it to!
- incredible
